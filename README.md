# Genre_Prediction_Capstone
Predicting Book Genres from their Descriptions

### Data
I collected the descriptions and genres for 4,500 books via the Goodreads API & direct web-scraping. The descriptions are the summaries written by the author & printed on the back or inside cover of a novel. When a user adds a book to their "want-to-read" or "currently-reading" list they can add the book to a shelve that matches how they describe the genre of the book. The genre that is collected from the web scrape is the shelf on which most users placed that book.

### Goal
The goal of this project is to accurately predict the user defined genre of a book based on its description. Accuracy for this project will be judged on the percentage of books that are correctly predicted as opposed to overall model accuracy.

## Organization
This project is organized in 4 notebooks:
- Data Collection
- Exploratory Data Analysis
- Modeling
- Exploratory Data Analysis - Visualizations

Data files can be found in the CSVs folder
